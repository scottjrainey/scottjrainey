Agentic Engineer | Builder

Engineering is changing, so I am too. Roles like "Software Engineer" and "Designer" will not be relevant much longer. While they still are, I'm an "Agentic Engineer", but really I'm a _builder_. Builders work with other builders and ai agents to build useful things. It's a different way of thinking and working. Most other knowledge workers are builders too now. **Even if they don't know it yet.**

**_Agentic engineers_ build AI-enhanced processes, tools, and infrastructure** that let other builders **work as close to bare metal as possible**. Most builders will create and work with code, but they won't write it.

_Agentic engineers_ don't write much code, if any. They **create agents** and **workflows for _those agents and other builders_**. Builders and agents use the same tools.

I keep some code and ideas I have found useful in becoming a builder here. I talk about things a lot more on ✨[my new blog](https://scottjrainey.engineer)✨.
