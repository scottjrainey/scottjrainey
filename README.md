Agentic Engineer | Builder

Engineering is changing, so I am too. Roles like "Software Engineer" and "Designer" will not be relevant much longer. While they still are, I'm an "Agentic Engineer", but really I'm a builder. Builders work with other builders and ai agents to build useful things. It's a different way of thinking and working. Most other knowledge workers are builders too now. Even if they don't know it yet.

Agentic engineers build AI-enhanced processes, tools, and infrastructure that let other builders work as close to bare metal as possible. Most builders will create and work with code, but they won't write it.

Agentic engineers don't write much code, if any. They create agents and workflows for those agents and other builders. Builders and agents use the same tools.

I keep some code and ideas I have found useful in becoming a builder here, on github, and talk about things a lot more on [my blog](https://scottjrainey.engineer).
